# Facial-Expression-Classification-WiserStack-Assignment

## Approach 1: CNN Model for Image Classification
This approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to directly classify facial expressions from grayscale images, leveraging the spatial hierarchies in the image data to learn features and predict the expression.

## Approach 2: Dual Input Model Combining Images and Facial Landmarks
This approach integrates both image data and facial landmarks as inputs, combining the CNN for image processing with an additional network to handle landmark data, aiming to improve expression recognition by leveraging geometric information about facial features.
